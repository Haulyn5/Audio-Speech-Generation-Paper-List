# Audio &amp; Speech Generation Paper List
A curated list of papers and resources in Speech &amp; Audio Generation. This project is just starting and still require a lot of work. So feel free to contribute!

## Paper

### Text to Speech (TTS)

* VALL-E: [Neural Codec Language Models are Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111) (2023-01, Microsoft) [[Unofficial code](https://github.com/enhuiz/vall-e)] 
* Your TTS: [YourTTS: Towards Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS and Zero-Shot Voice Conversion for Everyone](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/casanova22a.html) (ICML 2022) [[Code](https://github.com/coqui-ai/tts)]

### Voice Conversion (VC)

* Your TTS: [YourTTS: Towards Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS and Zero-Shot Voice Conversion for Everyone](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/casanova22a.html) (ICML 2022) [[Code](https://github.com/coqui-ai/tts)]

### Audio Generation/ Text to Audio (TTA)

### Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS)

### Speech to Speech Translation (S2ST/ STST)

* Seamless: [Seamless: Multilingual Expressive and Streaming Speech Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05187) (2023-12, Meta) [[Code and model opensourced](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication)]

### Text to Music(TTM)

## Software/ Libraries

### Speech Synthesis

* [BERT-VITS2](https://github.com/fishaudio/Bert-VITS2): A TTS tool shows great performance on Chinese speech synthesis.
* [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion): An Open-Source Audio, Music, and Speech Generation Toolkit. The Goal of Amphion is to offer a platform for studying the conversion of any inputs into audio. (TTS, SVS, VC, SVC, TTA, TTM) [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09911)]
